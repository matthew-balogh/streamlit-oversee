*Take a pause.*

Drop an anchor to slow down and reset. Use the **Anchor down!** button whenever you need a moment to reflect before continuing with a clearer mind.

### Introducing Dives

<small>2025.08.23</small>

*Don't know where to start? Don't worry about where to sail, just dive in!*

Use the **Dive!** button to capture your first thoughts, then shape them into a manuscript or link them to one you’re already working on.

<br>

### Create Manuscripts with ease

<small>2025.08.19</small>

You can now create new manuscripts by clicking on the **Write new Manuscript** button on the Manuscripts page.

> ⚠️ Warning: To prevent this feature from breaking, do not modify any files in the `_templates` folder.

### Introducing Vessels

<small>2025.08.18</small>

From now on, *Vessels* represent projects that enclose *manuscripts*.

For now, Oversee only supports a single project, therefore you cannot have more than one vessel. Nevertheless, the introduction of vessels brings a clarity on what you are working on with your manuscripts. Simply state the title and description of your project in `details.json` and `description.md` under `storage/vessel` and Oversee automatically updates the view to reflect your project details.

If you want to work on a new separate project, we recommend to clone a new Oversee repository and name it accordingly.

### Oversee is out

<small>2025.08.17</small>

*Oversee* is published and available to fork and clone from *GitHub* and *Streamlit*.
