### Create Manuscripts with ease
<small>2025.08.19</small>

You can now create new manuscripts by clicking on the **Write new Manuscript** button on the Manuscripts page.

> ⚠️ Warning: To prevent this feature from breaking, do not modify any files in the `_templates` folder.

### Introducing Vessels
<small>2025.08.18</small>

From now on, *Vessels* represent projects that enclose *manuscripts*. 

For now, Oversee only supports a single project, therefore you cannot have more than one vessel. Nevertheless, the introduction of vessels brings a clarity on what you are working on with your manuscripts. Simply state the title and description of your project in `details.json` and `description.md` under `storage/vessel` and Oversee automatically updates the view to reflect your project details.

If you want to work on a new separate project, we recommend to clone a new Oversee repository and name it accordingly.

### Oversee is out!

*Oversee* is published and available to fork and clone from *GitHub* and *Streamlit*.
