## About Oversee

*Oversee* provides a new angle in how you document and oversee your Data Science experiments.

## Demo

Try out the demo of [Oversee on Streamlit](https://oversee.streamlit.app).

## Getting started

There are two ways to get started with Oversee: either by running it on:

* your own machine
* *Streamlit Cloud*

### Running the app locally

   ```

   > üí° Tip: You can quickly create a copy in your own GitHub account by clicking the `Use this template` button above.

2. Install the requirements

   ```
   cd oversee-my-data-science-project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```
   streamlit run oversee_app.py
   ```

4. Use your favorite browser and editor to view and make changes

### Running the app on Streamlit Cloud

1. Visit the [demo on Streamlit Cloud](https://oversee.streamlit.app)
2. Fork the app to your account
   
   Click on the `Fork` button in the top right corner. Streamlit will create a standalone and public clone of the Oversee app in your account.

## How to use Oversee

Oversee provides a framework for your research work. Once downloaded to your machine, this Oversee environment is available for you to start your work, even to customize according to your taste using the Streamlit syntax.

While being a dynamic wrapper for your notebooks and research notes, you are still required to make the content changes in the file structure using an editor.
