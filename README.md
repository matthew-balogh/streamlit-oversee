## How to use Oversee

Oversee provides a framework for your research work. Once downloaded to your machine, this Oversee environment is available for you to start your work, even to customize according to your taste using the Streamlit syntax.

While being a dynamic wrapper for your notebooks and research notes, you are still required to make the content changes in the file structure using an editor.

Youâ€™ll find guidance both in the example manuscript and while creating a new one.
